# react-firebase-app

problem #1

- running firebase serve to test locally gets an error
- Error: Could not load the default credentials.
- appear to need an environment with a json key, but routes are testable with firebase deploy so i will solve this problem later

solved problem #1

- ended up having to solve this to continue. deploying to test changes was slow going
- added Admin SDK configuration snippet
